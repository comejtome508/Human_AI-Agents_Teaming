## Chapter 01_Key Takeaway

### üõ† Key Shifts from Traditional ML Engineering

| Aspect                | Traditional ML Engineering      | AI Engineering (FMs)                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Model development     | Train models from scratch       | Adapt existing large models (via prompts, finetuning) |
| Required knowledge    | Strong ML/algorithm expertise   | Focus on application-building, interface design       |
| Evaluation challenges | Mostly structured/closed tasks  | Open-ended outputs, harder-to-define success          |
| Compute needs         | Smaller, often tabular models   | Huge models, GPU clusters, inference optimization     |
| App development focus | ML model as a backend component | App interface, prompt design, fast iteration          |

### üí° Core Techniques in AI Engineering
- **Prompt engineering** ‚Üí Crafting the right queries/instructions.
- **RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)** ‚Üí Supplementing the model with external data.
- **Finetuning** ‚Üí Updating model weights for domain-specific needs.
- **Evaluation & Feedback Loops** ‚Üí Critical for improving AI outputs.

### üîç Planning AI Applications
Ask: Why build this?

- Existential risk?
- Boost efficiency/profit?
- Explore new opportunities?

Consider:
- AI‚Äôs role (critical or complementary?)
- Human-in-the-loop or fully automated?
- Product defensibility & differentiation
- Milestones, success metrics, and maintenance costs

# Insights
- Using traditional ML models and making AI applications on the foundation models needs different process and approach.
- Inference optimization is more and more important.
- Fine tunning is not Prompt Engineering.
